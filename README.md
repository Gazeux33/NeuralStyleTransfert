# Neural Style Transfert

<br>

This project is an implementation of Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch. Neural Style Transfer is a deep learning technique that merges the style of one image with the content of another, creating visually striking results by blending artistic features with photographic details.

style transfert different of neural style transfert


feature MAP
GRAM Matrix
gram matrix = different product between different features map


init methode can be:
- style 
- content
- random





1. prepare and load images
2. Gaussion noise
3. On peut parti du contenu ou bien du bruit ou bien du style je crois
